### Introduction

**PALM**db is a database of viral polymerase palmprint (barcode) sequences classified (1) by taxonomy and (2) by clustering sequences into species-like operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 90% identity. **PALM**db was created using the [palmscan](https://github.com/rcedgar/palmscan) algorithm to mine public sequence databases.

### 2021-03-14 update with 250,000+ new sequences, 130,000+ new species

Added new sequences generated by the [Serratus](https://serratus.io/) project, see [paper on biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.241729v2).

### Palmprint sequence

![PALMdb](http://drive5.com/images/palm_structure_figure.png)

The palmprint is a ~100aa segment of the viral polymerase gene delineated by the conserved catalytic motifs "A" and "C" in the palm sub-domain.

### Files

Releases are posted in sub-directories named `YYYY-MM-DD` giving the date the release was posted. Files are in FASTA (for sequences) or tab-separated values (TSV, for annotations). Files and formats are subject to change between releases.
